Predictive Maintenance
==============================

### Problem Statement
Model the err(error), and errf(Filtered_Error) columns for individual 'scanners' to show an expected failure rate of the encoder component. 
	Scanners are identified into two groups, based on the following criteria and grouping:
1.	never fail: scanners that never reach the 12 % range for err
2.	routinely fail: scanners that reach the 12% range for error on a routine basis

Error(err) and Filtered_error(errf) are both float values, they are loosely tied to each other, and are not a 1 for 1 relationship, e.g. a rising err value doesn't mean an errf value will rise, nor the opposite.

Failure is defined as an error that is above 12 % and/or a Filtered_error that is above 0.5 %

Background:  err and errf represent an encoder error rate at which a led light is pulsating into a window barrier.  This barrier, and subsequent calculation, represent the rate of rotation of a component, and the compensated Error and Error Filtered value.
